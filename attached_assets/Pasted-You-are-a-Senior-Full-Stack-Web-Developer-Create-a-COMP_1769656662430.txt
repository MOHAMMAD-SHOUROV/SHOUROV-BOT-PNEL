FUNCTIONALITY

- Show:
  - How many groups the bot is added to
  - Who are bot admins
  - Bot storage usage
  - Bot files list
  - Ability to view files
  - Ability to change/edit files (frontend demo)
- Show current Bangladesh time
- Social icons:

- Neon lights across the panel with changing colors
- Every button, card, and section must have different neon colors
- Touch or hover anywhere should trigger light/glow animations
